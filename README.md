## Exam System
this system built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. This project simulates a real-world quiz/exam experience with level-based progression and dynamic scoring.

## Key Features:

📌 Score tracking: Each correct answer adds to the total score.

📌 Locked answers: Once an option is selected, it becomes unchangeable.

📌 Grade calculation: At the end of each level, the system calculates the grade (e.g., Excellent, Good, or Failed).

📌 Level control: Users must score at least 60% to unlock the next level.

🔁 Retry logic: If a user fails, they are allowed one retake. If they fail again, they must wait before retrying.

📱 Responsive design: Optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices using Bootstrap 5.
